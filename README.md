# Project Overview

## Architecture
This project strictly follows the mvvm Software Architectural Pattern.

MVVM(Model–View–ViewModel) is an Architectural Pattern that escalates separation of concerns. It also groups the components of a system into three parts namely:

- Model: The model is usually the representation of data or business logic. It contains properties that helps understand the subject the model          represents.
- ViewModel: The viewmodel is an abstraction of the view . Resposible for the management of the states and actions that takes place in the view 
- View: The view represents the layout and appearances a user sees on the screen.
